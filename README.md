##Overview




###Bitcoin is the world's first decentralized digital currency.  Transactions occur between users directly, without an intermediary.  

### Like e-mail addresses, you can send bitcoins to a person by sending bitcoins to one of their addresses. However, unlike e-mail addresses, people have many different Bitcoin addresses, often for different purposes.

### Most Bitcoin addresses are 34 characters, and encoded in a format called Base58. They consist of random digits and uppercase and lowercase letters, such as "1CK6KHY6MHgYvmRQ4PAafKYDrg1ejbH1cE".  It would be extremely difficulty to keep track of let alone memorize one's bitcoin addresses.

### BTC Manager allows a user to label, and store multiple addresses so that their pertinent information is readily accessible.
